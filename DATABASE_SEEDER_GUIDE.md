# üå± Database Seeder Guide

## Overview

The database seeder automatically generates realistic test data for your daycare application, making it easy to test all features without manually creating records.

## üöÄ How to Use the Seeder

### Method 1: Automatic Seeding (On Startup)

The seeder runs automatically when you start the backend:

```powershell
Set-Location "c:\laragon\www\daycare\DaycareAPI"
dotnet run
```

**What happens:**
1. Database migrations are applied automatically
2. Seeder checks if data already exists
3. If database is empty, it seeds all data
4. If data exists, it skips seeding

**Console Output:**
```
Database migrations applied successfully.
Starting database seeding...
Role 'Admin' created.
Role 'Parent' created.
Role 'Staff' created.
Admin user created successfully.
10 parents seeded.
12 children seeded.
250+ attendance records seeded.
400+ daily activities seeded.
30+ notifications seeded.
Database seeding completed successfully!
```

---

### Method 2: Manual Seeding (Using API Endpoints)

You can also trigger seeding manually using the Seed API:

#### **Get Seeding Status**
```http
GET http://localhost:5000/api/seed/status
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "parents": 10,
  "children": 12,
  "attendances": 252,
  "dailyActivities": 420,
  "notifications": 32,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00"
}
```

#### **Run Seeder Manually**
```http
POST http://localhost:5000/api/seed/run
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Database seeded successfully!",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00"
}
```

#### **Clear All Data**
```http
DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/seed/clear
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** This deletes all parents, children, attendance, activities, and notifications!

#### **Reset Database (Clear + Reseed)**
```http
POST http://localhost:5000/api/seed/reset
```

This is useful when you want fresh test data.

## üîß Customizing the Seeder

### Add More Parents/Children

Edit `DatabaseSeeder.cs` and add more entries to the lists:

```csharp
// In SeedParentsAndChildrenAsync method
var parents = new List<Parent>
{
    // Add more parents here
    new Parent
    {
        FirstName = "Your",
        LastName = "Name",
        Email = "your.email@email.com",
        PhoneNumber = "555-0111",
        Address = "Your Address",
        ProfilePicture = profilePictures[0],
        CreatedAt = DateTime.Now
    }
};
```

### Change Activity Types

Edit the `activityTypes` array in `SeedDailyActivitiesAsync`:

```csharp
var activityTypes = new[] { "Meal", "Nap", "Play", "Learning", "Outdoor", "Art", "Music" };
```

### Adjust Date Ranges

Change the loop ranges:

```csharp
// For more attendance records
for (int i = 0; i < 60; i++) // Change from 30 to 60 days

// For more activities
for (int i = 0; i < 14; i++) // Change from 7 to 14 days
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Seeder Not Running
**Problem:** No data appears after starting backend

**Solutions:**
1. Check console output for errors
2. Verify database connection in `appsettings.json`
3. Make sure MySQL server is running
4. Check if data already exists (seeder skips if data found)

### Duplicate Key Errors
**Problem:** Error about duplicate email addresses

**Solutions:**
1. Clear the database first: `POST /api/seed/clear`
2. Then reseed: `POST /api/seed/run`
3. Or use reset: `POST /api/seed/reset`

### Migration Errors
**Problem:** Error applying migrations

**Solutions:**
1. Check database connection string
2. Verify MySQL user has proper permissions
3. Manually apply migrations:
   ```powershell
   Set-Location "c:\laragon\www\daycare\DaycareAPI"
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

### Images Not Showing
**Problem:** Profile pictures don't display

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Base64 encoding is correct
3. Check if `default-avatar.svg` exists in frontend assets
4. Clear browser cache

## üéØ Best Practices

### Development
- ‚úÖ Use seeder for initial development testing
- ‚úÖ Reset database when testing new features
- ‚úÖ Keep seeder updated with new fields

### Testing
- ‚úÖ Use seeded data for UI/UX testing
- ‚úÖ Test filters and sorting with realistic data
- ‚úÖ Verify performance with seeded records

### Production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER** run seeder in production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Disable seed endpoints in production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use proper data migration strategies

---

## üîí Security Notes

### Seed Controller Endpoints
The Seed Controller endpoints are currently **unprotected**. For production:

1. **Add Authorization:**
   ```csharp
   [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
   public class SeedController : ControllerBase
   ```

2. **Disable in Production:**
   ```csharp
   #if DEBUG
   [Route("api/[controller]")]
   [ApiController]
   public class SeedController : ControllerBase
   #endif
   ```

3. **Remove from Production Build:**
   - Don't deploy SeedController.cs to production
   - Comment out seeding code in Program.cs for production

Your database seeder is now ready to use! It will:

‚úÖ Automatically seed data on first run
‚úÖ Generate realistic test data
‚úÖ Include profile pictures for all parents and children
‚úÖ Create attendance records and activities
