## üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes

### New Fields Added:

**Parents Table:**
- `ProfilePicture` (longtext, nullable) - Stores Base64 encoded images

**Children Table:**
- `EnrollmentDate` (datetime(6), NOT NULL) - Stores enrollment date with default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

### Migration File:
`DaycareAPI/Migrations/20250115000000_AddProfilePictureAndEnrollmentDate.cs`

---

## üöÄ How to Apply Database Migration

### Option 1: Restart Backend (Automatic)
If your backend is configured to auto-migrate on startup:
```powershell
# Stop the backend (Ctrl+C in the terminal running it)
# Then restart it
Set-Location "c:\laragon\www\daycare\DaycareAPI"
dotnet run
```

### Option 2: Manual SQL Execution
Run these SQL commands directly in your MySQL database:

```sql
USE DaycareDB;

-- Add ProfilePicture column to Parents table
ALTER TABLE `Parents` 
ADD COLUMN `ProfilePicture` LONGTEXT NULL;

-- Add EnrollmentDate column to Children table
ALTER TABLE `Children` 
ADD COLUMN `EnrollmentDate` DATETIME(6) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6);
```

### Option 3: Using EF Core CLI (if available)
```powershell
Set-Location "c:\laragon\www\daycare\DaycareAPI"
dotnet ef database update
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Image Storage:
- Images are stored as Base64 strings in the database
- This is convenient for small applications but may impact performance with many large images
- Consider file system or cloud storage for production environments

### Enrollment Date:
- New field is required when adding children
- Existing children will have enrollment date set to their creation timestamp
- Date filter falls back to `createdAt` if `enrollmentDate` is missing

### Browser Compatibility:
- FileReader API is used (supported in all modern browsers)
- Bootstrap Icons required for proper icon display
- CSS Grid and Flexbox used (IE11 not supported)

### Performance:
- Filtering and sorting happen client-side
- For large datasets (1000+ children), consider server-side filtering
- Base64 images increase payload size

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Images Not Showing:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `default-avatar.svg` exists in `src/assets/`
3. Check if Base64 string is properly stored in database
4. Verify image file size is under 2MB

### Filters Not Working:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify `enrollmentDate` field exists in database
3. Check if children data is loading properly
4. Try clearing filters and reloading page

### Grid View Layout Issues:
1. Verify Bootstrap CSS is loaded
2. Check browser window size (grid adapts to screen size)
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check for CSS conflicts

### Migration Errors:
1. Verify database connection string in `appsettings.json`
2. Check if MySQL server is running
3. Verify database user has ALTER TABLE permissions
4. Check if columns already exist (migration may have run already)

2. **Test All Features** - Go through the testing checklist above
3. **Add Sample Data** - Create some parents and children with pictures
4. **Test Responsive Design** - Check on different screen sizes
5. **Performance Testing** - Test with larger datasets if needed
