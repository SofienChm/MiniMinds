## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Apply Database Migration First!

Before testing, you need to add the new database columns. Choose ONE method:

### Method 1: Quick SQL (Easiest)
Open your MySQL client (phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, etc.) and run:

```sql
USE DaycareDB;

ALTER TABLE `Parents` 
ADD COLUMN `ProfilePicture` LONGTEXT NULL;

ALTER TABLE `Children` 
ADD COLUMN `EnrollmentDate` DATETIME(6) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6);
```

### Method 2: Restart Backend
Stop and restart your backend server - it may auto-apply migrations.
