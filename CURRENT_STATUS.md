## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Frontend Not Loading?
**Check if it's still building:**
```powershell
# Look for the Angular process
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like '*node*'}
```

**If it's taking too long:**
- Wait 1-2 minutes for first build
- Check for errors in the terminal where you ran `npm start`

### Backend Not Responding?
**Check if it's running:**
```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -eq 'DaycareAPI'}
```

**If not running, restart it:**
```powershell
cd c:\laragon\www\daycare\DaycareAPI
dotnet run
```

### Can't Connect to Database?
**Verify MySQL is running:**
```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.Name -like '*mysql*'}
```

**If not running:**
- Open Laragon
- Click "Start All"

### Port Already in Use?
**If port 5000 is busy:**
- Stop other applications using port 5000
- Or change the port in `DaycareAPI/Properties/launchSettings.json`

**If port 4200 is busy:**
- Stop other Angular applications
- Or run: `ng serve --port 4201`
